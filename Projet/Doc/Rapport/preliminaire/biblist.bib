Researchers are developing software and hardware for high performance race vehicles which aim to operate autonomously on the edge of the vehicles limits: High speeds, high accelerations, low reaction times, highly uncertain, dynamic and adversarial environments. This paper represents the first holistic survey that covers the research in the field of autonomous racing. We focus on the field of autonomous racecars only and display the algorithms, methods and approaches that are used in the fields of perception, planning and control as well as end-to-end learning. Further, with an increasing number of autonomous racing competitions, researchers now have access to a range of high performance platforms to test and evaluate their autonomy algorithms. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the current autonomous racing platforms emphasizing both the software-hardware co-evolution to the current stage. Finally, based on additional discussion with leading researchers in the field we conclude with a summary of open research challenges that will guide future researchers in this field.},

However, the control systems for autonomous driving vehicles still pose challenges, since vehicle speed and steering angle are always subject to strict constraints in vehicle dynamics. The optimal control action for vehicle speed and steering angular velocity can be obtained from the online objective function, subject to the dynamic constraints of the vehicle’s physical limitations, the environmental conditions, and the surrounding obstacles. This paper presents the design of a nonlinear model predictive controller subject to hard and softened constraints. Nonlinear model predictive control subject to softened constraints provides a higher probability of the controller ﬁnding the optimal control actions and maintaining system stability. Different parameters of the nonlinear model predictive controller are simulated and analyzed. Results show that nonlinear model predictive control with softened constraints can considerably improve the ability of autonomous driving vehicles to track exactly on different trajectories.},

Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in computational requirements. The side-by-side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assists with system level design choices.},

Autonomous vehicle decision making is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), then extended to a QMDP framework. Based on MDP/QMDP, three kinds of uncertainties are taken into account: sensor noise, perception constraints and surrounding vehicles’ behavior. In simulation, the QMDP-based reasoning framework makes the autonomous vehicle perform with differing levels of conservativeness corresponding to different perception conﬁdence levels. Road tests also indicate that the proposed algorithm helps the vehicle in avoiding potentially unsafe situations under these uncertainties. In general, the results indicate that the proposed QMDP-based algorithm makes autonomous driving more robust to limited sensing ability and occasional sensor failures.},

To limit the impact of such failures, this paper presents the redundant perception and state estimation approaches developed for an autonomous race car. Redundancy in perception is achieved by estimating the color and position of the track delimiting objects using two sensor modalities independently. Speciﬁcally, learning-based approaches are used to generate color and pose estimates, from LiDAR and camera data respectively. The redundant perception inputs are fused by a particle ﬁlter based SLAM algorithm that operates in real-time. Velocity is estimated using slip dynamics, with reliability being ensured through a probabilistic failure detection algorithm. The sub-modules are extensively evaluated in realworld racing conditions using the autonomous race car gotthard driverless, achieving lateral accelerations up to 1.7G and a top speed of 90km/h.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04882},
	abstract = {In this paper we propose a hierarchical controller for autonomous racing where the same vehicle model is used in a two level optimization framework for motion planning. The high-level controller computes a trajectory that minimizes the lap time, and the low-level nonlinear model predictive path following controller tracks the computed trajectory online. Following a computed optimal trajectory avoids online planning and enables fast computational times. The efﬁciency is further enhanced by the coupling of the two levels through a terminal constraint, computed in the high-level controller. Including this constraint in the real-time optimization level ensures that the prediction horizon can be shortened, while safety is guaranteed. This proves crucial for the experimental validation of the approach on a full size driverless race car. The vehicle in question won two international student racing competitions using the proposed framework; moreover, our hierarchical controller achieved an improvement of 20\% in the lap time compared to the state of the art result achieved using a very similar car and track.},

	abstract = {Velocity estimation plays a central role in driverless vehicles, but standard and affordable methods struggle to cope with extreme scenarios like aggressive maneuvers due to the presence of high sideslip. To solve this, autonomous race cars are usually equipped with expensive external velocity sensors. In this paper, we present an end-to-end recurrent neural network that takes available raw sensors as input (IMU, wheel odometry, and motor currents) and outputs velocity estimates. The results are compared to two state-of-the-art Kalman ﬁlters, which respectively include and exclude expensive velocity sensors. All methods have been extensively tested on a formula student driverless race car with very high sideslip (10°at the rear axle) and slip ratio (≈ 20\%), operating close to the limits of handling. The proposed network is able to estimate lateral velocity up to 15x better than the Kalman ﬁlter with the equivalent sensor input and matches (0.06 m/s RMSE) the Kalman ﬁlter with the expensive velocity sensor setup.},

Researchers have argued that DP provides the appropriate basis for compiling planning results into reactive strategies for real-time control, as well as for learning such strategies when the system being controlled is incompletely known. We introduce an algorithm based on DP, which we call Real-Time DP (RTDP), by which an embedded system can improve its performance with experience. RTDP generalizes Korf’s Learning-Real-Time-A* algorithm to problems involving uncertainty. We invoke results from the theory of asynchronous DP to prove that RTDP achieves optimal behavior in several different classes of problems. We also use the theory of asynchronous DP to illuminate aspects of other DP-based reinforcement learning methods such as Watkins’ Q-Learning algorithm. A secondary aim of this article is to provide a bridge between AI research on real-time planning and learning and relevant concepts and algorithms from control theory.},

	abstract = {The best race driver is the one that, with a given vehicle, is able to drive on a given track in the shortest possible time. Thus, the only target is the lap time. A race driver model has to do the same. The ﬁrst step towards this target is to decide which trajectory to follow. In fact, the optimal trajectory is the best compromise between the shortest track and the track that allows to achieve the highest speeds (least curvature track). Thus, the problem of trajectory planning is a bounded optimisation problem that has to take into account not only the geometry of the circuit but also the dynamics of the vehicle. A simpliﬁed vehicle dynamic model is used for this purpose. Due to the fact that the vehicle will be driven at its limit performances, although simpliﬁed, the model has to correctly reproduce the maximum possible acceleration, a function of the vehicle speed, the maximum possible deceleration, again a function of the vehicle speed, and the maximum lateral acceleration, a function of both the vehicle speed and the steering angle. Knowing the trajectory, the vehicle model allows to determine the lap time. Through an optimisation algorithm it is therefore possible to determine the best compromise between shortest track and track with the minimum curvature, i.e. the trajectory (in terms of track and speed proﬁle) that allows to minimize the time lap.},

The kinematics of the suspension is exhaustively analysed and the impact of tyre longitudinal and lateral forces in determining vehicle trim is demonstrated. An indirect optimal control method is then used to solve the minimum lap time problem. Simulation outcomes are compared with experimental data acquired during a qualifying lap at Montmelo´ circuit (Barcelona) in the 2012 GP2 season.

First, a high-level planner computes an optimal trajectory around the track, then in realtime a mid-level nonlinear model predictive controller follows this path using the high-level information as guidance. Finally a high frequency, low-level controller tracks the states predicted by the mid-level controller. Tracking the predicted behavior has two advantages: it reduces the mismatch between the model used in the upper layers and the real car, and allows for a torque vectoring command to be optimized by the higher level motion planners. The tailored design of the low-level controller proved to be crucial for bridging the gap between planning and control, unlocking unseen performance in autonomous racing. The proposed approach was veriﬁed on a full size racecar, considerably improving over the state-of-the-art results achieved on the same vehicle.

	abstract = {This paper shows the planning of time-optimal trajectories, which allows an autonomous race car to drive at the handling limits, taking into account locally changing road friction values. For this purpose, the minimum lap time problem is described as an optimal control problem, converted to a nonlinear programme using direct orthogonal Gauss-Legendre collocation and then solved by the interiorpoint method IPOPT. Reduced computing times are achieved using a curvilinear abscissa approach for track description, algorithmic differentiation using the software framework CasADi, and a smoothing of the track input data by approximate spline regression. The vehicle’s behaviour is approximated as a single track and double track model with quasi-steady state tyre load simplification and nonlinear tyre model. The results are used to evaluate which vehicle physics are important for the calculation of the time-optimal trajectory. The novelty of this work is the consideration of wheel-specific tyre-road friction coefficients along the racetrack using a track friction map. It is shown that variable friction coefficients have a significant impact on the trajectory, and therefore significantly improve lap times on inhomogenous racetracks. The proposed trajectory planning has proven its practical suitability in first tests on an autonomous race car and will be used in the coming racing season in the Roborace competition.},

The key problem is to guide the car to the destination in real-time with a safe and obstacle free path in real-world environments. We propose an innovative self-driving car navigation approach that incorporates a VFH (Vector Field Histogram) local path planner adapted for modern 3D laser scanners and a global path planner using satellite positioning and digital map along with a custom built PID controller (Proportional Integral Derivative controller). Since classical path planning methods such as VFH are often used on small robots with ultrasonic rangefinders or in simulation based environments, we applied the VFH method to a real self-driving car with two different LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) configurations. The quantitative results from extensive experiments indicate that the developed VFH method with the modern real-time 3D LiDAR generally outperform the conventional LIDAR in terms of efficiency, accuracy and reliability. In addition, the tracks produced by 3D LIDAR are more convergent, smooth and consistent than the other configuration. The maximum position deviation for the VFH with 3D LiDAR is 0.28 m and −0.16 m while the deviation for the other low-cost solution is 0.88 m and −0.49 m respectively. The global path planner can provide an accuracy of within 1 meter most of the time. The proposed approach is successfully implemented and tested on our self-driving car which took part in the national self-driving car competitions in recent years, and ranked No.3 and 4. in the future challenge 2014 self-driving car competition in China.},

At the same time, an objective assessment and especially imitation of professional race drivers is difficult due to individual driving styles, complex and nondeterministic decision making processes, and small stability margins. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to identify and model individual race driving styles in a robust way. We develop the Driver Identification and Metric Ranking Algorithm (DIMRA) as a data-based method for an in-depth objective analysis and assessment of professional race drivers. Supported by this knowledge, we extend and adapt the imitation learning framework Probabilistic Modeling of Driver Behavior (ProMoD) in order to model race drivers in a complex simulation environment. An evaluation with data from professional race drivers shows the capability of DIMRA to derive metrics which describe human race driving styles, as well as ProMoD to robustly generate competitive laps with human-like controls in a professional motorsport driving simulator. The ability to identify and imitate individual driving styles does not only support the performance optimisation of race cars but could also aid the development of road cars and driver assistance systems in future work.},

	abstract = {The problem of maneuvering a vehicle through a race course in minimum time requires computation of both longitudinal (brake and throttle) and lateral (steering wheel) control inputs. Unfortunately, solving the resulting nonlinear optimal control problem is typically computationally expensive and infeasible for real-time trajectory planning. This paper presents an iterative algorithm that divides the path generation task into two sequential subproblems that are significantly easier to solve. Given an initial path through the race track, the algorithm runs a forward–backward integration scheme to determine the minimum-time longitudinal speed profile, subject to tire friction constraints. With this fixed speed profile, the algorithm updates the vehicle's path by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the resulting path curvature while staying within track boundaries and obeying affine, time-varying vehicle dynamics constraints. This two-step process is repeated iteratively until the predicted lap time no longer improves. While providing no guarantees of convergence or a globally optimal solution, the approach performs very well when validated on the Thunderhill Raceway course in Willows, CA. The predicted lap time converges after four to five iterations, with each iteration over the full 4.5 km race course requiring only 30 s of computation time on a laptop computer. The resulting trajectory is experimentally driven at the race circuit with an autonomous Audi TTS test vehicle, and the resulting lap time and racing line are comparable to both a nonlinear gradient descent solution and a trajectory recorded from a professional racecar driver. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is a viable option for online trajectory planning in the near future.},

The minimum curvature path is generated using a quadratic optimisation problem (QP) formulation. The key contributions of this paper are the extension of the QP for an improved accuracy of the curvature approximation, the introduction of curvature constraints and the iterative invocation of the QP to significantly reduce linearisation errors in corners. On the basis of the resulting raceline, a velocity profile is calculated using a forward-backward-solver that considers the velocity dependent longitudinal and lateral acceleration limits of the car. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed trajectory planning approach are discussed critically with respect to practical experience from various racetracks. The software stack showed to be robust in a real world environment as it ran successfully on the Roborace DevBot during the Berlin Formula E event in May 2018. The lap time achieved was within a tenth of a second of a human driver and the car reached about 150 km/h and 80\% of its acceleration limits.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear effects and external disturbances can severely impact the control of an autonomous race car at the handling limits. State-ofthe-art approaches do not take these uncertainties explicitly into account in the design process and are therefore prone to failure. To overcome this limitation, we present a robust control design based on tube model predictive control (TMPC). It is based on a simplified friction limited point-mass model and an additive disturbance for the lateral and longitudinal dynamics. Instead of nominal predictions, it leverages an approximate tube of reachable sets over the prediction horizon to guarantee constraint satisfaction. The resulting optimisation problem can be posed in the form of a standard quadratic programme by tightening the input and state constraints. The computational burden is therefore the same as in the nominal case. We benchmark our controller on a Hardware-in-the-Loop testbench with a nonlinear dual-track model and a combined Pacejka tyre model. The results demonstrate that the TMPC controller reduces the constraint violations while achieving comparable lap-times in contrast to an MPC controller and an infinite time LQR controller. It manages to apply caution when needed while maintaining a similar level of performance and is therefore considered to be superior in practical applications.},

Using a dynamical model of the vehicle, control inputs are computed by receding horizon based controllers, where the objective is to maximize progress on the track subject to the requirement of staying on the track and avoiding opponents. Two different control formulations are presented. The ﬁrst controller employs a two-level structure, consisting of a path planner and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for tracking. The second controller combines both tasks in one nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) following the ideas of contouring control. Linear time varying models obtained by linearization are used to build local approximations of the control NLPs in the form of convex quadratic programs (QPs) at each sampling time. The resulting QPs have a typical MPC structure and can be solved in the range of milliseconds by recent structure exploiting solvers, which is key to the real-time feasibility of the overall control scheme. Obstacle avoidance is incorporated by means of a high-level corridor planner based on dynamic programming, which generates convex constraints for the controllers according to the current position of opponents and the track layout. The control performance is investigated experimentally using 1:43 scale RC race cars, driven at speeds of more than 3 m/s and in operating regions with saturated rear tire forces (drifting). The algorithms run at 50 Hz sampling rate on embedded computing platforms, demonstrating the real-time feasibility and high performance of optimization-based approaches for autonomous racing.},

	abstract = {The geometric controller is widely used to solve the path tracking problem in the autonomous vehicle. However, its performance is dependent on the look-ahead distance that is difﬁcult to be decided in the real driving. Besides, the geometric relationship isn’t enough to express the impacts of the tracking error in some extreme driving situations. In this paper, we use the geometric controller Pure Pursuit as the basic controller, and add PI (Proportional Integral) controller to improve the above geometric controller’s problems. We name our controller as P P P I. Moreover, to reduce the sudden change in the steering angle and improve the steering stability, we design a low-pass ﬁlter to smooth the ﬁnal output steering angle. To assess the performance of P P P I, we compare P P P I with Pure Pursuit and P ID on the simulator. The experiment results prove P P P I could effectively reduce the dependence on the look-ahead distance and obtain better tracking performance.},

	abstract = {Wright Laboratory, at Tyndall AFB, Florida, has contracted the University ofFlorida to develop autonomous navigation systems for a variety ofrobotic vehicles, capable ofperforming tasks associated with the location and removal of bombs and mines. One ofthe tasks involves surveying closed target ranges for unexploded buried munitions. Accuracy in path following is critical to the task. There are hundreds of acres that currently require surveying. The sites are typically divided into regions, where each mission can take up to 4.5 hours. These sites are usually surveyed along parallel rows. By improving the accuracy ofpath following, the distance betweenthe rows can be increased to nearly the detection width ofthe ground penetrating sensors, resulting in increased acreage surveyed per mission. This paper evaluates a high-level PID and a pure pursuit steering controller. The controllers were combined into a weighted solution so that the desirable features of each controller is preserved. This strategy was demonstrated in simulation and implemented on a Navigation Test Vehicle (NTV). For a test path ofvarying curvature, the average lateral control error was 2 cm at a vehicle speed of 1.34 mIs.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the self-driving car technologies have been developed with many successful stories in both academia and industry. The challenge for autonomous vehicles is the requirement of operating accurately and robustly in the urban environment. This paper focuses on how to efﬁciently solve the hierarchical control system of a self-driving car into practice. This technique is composed of decision making, local path planning and control. An ego vehicle is navigated by global path planning with the aid of a High Deﬁnition map. Firstly, we propose the decision making for motion planning by applying a two-stage Finite State Machine to manipulate mission planning and control states. Furthermore, we implement a real-time hybrid A* algorithm with an occupancy grid map to ﬁnd an efﬁcient route for obstacle avoidance. Secondly, the local path planning is conducted to generate a safe and comfortable trajectory in unstructured scenarios. Herein, we solve an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints to optimize the sum of jerks for a smooth drive. In addition, controllers are designed by using the pure pursuit algorithm and the scheduled feedforward PI controller for lateral and longitudinal direction, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can operate efﬁciently in the urban scenario.},
